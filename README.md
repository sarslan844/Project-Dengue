# Dengue Diagnosis Program

## How It Works
The program:
1. Welcomes the user to the Dengue Diagnosis.
2. Asks 7 yes/no questions related to common dengue symptoms.
3. Tracks the number of "yes" responses and provides feedback based on the total score.

## Questions Asked

1- Do you have a high fever?
2- Are you experiencing severe headaches?
3- Do you feel pain behind the eyes?
4- Do you have joint or muscle pain?
5- Have you noticed any skin rash?
6- Are you feeling nauseous or vomiting?
7- Do you feel fatigued or weak?
##  Diagnosis Output

-> 6 or more: High likelihood of dengue. Immediate medical consultation recommended.
-> 4 to 5: Possible dengue symptoms. Seek medical advice.
-> 2 to 3: Some symptoms present, but may not be dengue. Monitor your health.
